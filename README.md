====================

Ruby sample application for wercker leveraging the Sinatra microframework
Wercker is a continuous delivery platform see: http://wercker.com

This application was made as a companion to a couple of our [devcenter](http://devcenter.wercker.com) articles:
* In [devcenter - getting started](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/gettingstarted/) this repository can be used as a template to familiarize yourself with the main wercker interfaces (both the web and command line interface).
* The [devcenter - getting started with ruby and sinatra](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/ruby/getting-started-sinatra-api.html) article shows you how to create this repository by yourself.
